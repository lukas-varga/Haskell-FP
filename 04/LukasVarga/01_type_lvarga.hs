-- For each named expression replace "undefined"

-- with an expression with the same type as the declaration

-- Note where the answer is a list, you will not get marks for giving an empty list as an answer, 

-- even though it is syntactically correct. (Nice idea, though!)



j1:: (String,Integer)

j1 = ("Lukas",5)

-- possible answer here would be 

-- j1 = ("Me", 1)



j2:: [Bool]

j2 =  [True,False,True]



j3:: ([Integer], String)

j3 =  ([1..10], "Test")





j4:: [[Double]]

j4 = [[2.5,3.14],[2.5,3.14]]





j5:: (Integer,String)

j5 =  (5,"Test")



j6:: (Integer,[(String,Integer, String)])

j6 = (5,[("Morning",5, "Evening"),("Morning",10, "Evening")])



j7:: [(Integer, [Char])]

j7 =  [(5, ['a','b']),(6, "Lukas")]



j8:: [[(Integer,Integer)]]

j8 = [[(5,5),(6,7)],[(6,8)]]
